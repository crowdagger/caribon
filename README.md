Caribon
=======

A repetition detector written in Rust.

Why?
====

I don't think it's really the case in english, but in french (and
possibly other languages), it is considered poor style to repeat a
word too often in a text (particularly a literary text). The purpose
of this tool is to assist a writer in detecting those repetitions.

Why the name?
=============

A text is composed of words, themselves composed of characters, which
in french are called *caract√®res*. In french, *good* is *bon* so
*caribon* is essentially *good characters*.

Alright, this doesn't make much sense, I'll admit I just found the
name funny.
